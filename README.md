# one-time-access
A :deamon:, written in dash/shell that scans a specific folder for files to be then moved to a unique path to let lighttpd serve the file under an unique address. 

Files may be transfered for example via ssh/scp, sftp, samba or similar.

A solution to provide links to the uploader is not yet implemented. At the moment weblinks can be found at the log files.
